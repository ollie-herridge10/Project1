# The IPA Way

### The IPA Way is a crafted Indian Pale Ale business created to contiue the IPA movement across the globe. This website has been created to detail the look, the menu and the location of the new bar that has opened in London.
### The home page offers an overall feel and vibe to the company and what should be expected when you visit the the bar. The menu page gives the website visitor a clear idea of the drinks that will be on offer and some food selections as well. The book page has information around the opening times, ytable booking form and Google Maps location finder.

# Site Owner Goals

* A site made with the IPA industry in mind that pops with unique colours and ease of use.
* Friendly navigation to easily find out what you can drink, eat and do at the bar and find out where it's located.
* An easy booking system highlighted with a vibrant button to be able to book a table within the opening hours shown.

# Customer Experience

* I wanted the customer to feel like they are welcomed to the world of IPAs but can instantly tell that this is a bar and not a place to buy products.
* The easy navigation and scroll through each part of the website is highlighted with bold headings explaing what each part of the website means.
* First time visiters to the websites get a clear indication of who we are, what happens at our bar, where is it and when it's open.
* Reoccuring visitors who come to book a table get that ease of use as the button take them straight to the form.

# Design

## Images
#### The images I have incorporated into my website give a real feel of what to expect when you arrive at the bar. The two big hero images show real detail into what the bar looks like and gives off the vibe of the place as well. The smaller images I have portray the finer details about my bar including the fun and games you can have there.

## Fonts
#### I chose the Righteous font for my website as I believe it carries the weight of the IPA industry with it. The indsutry is fun and playful so I thought Righteous had the right tone.

## Colours
#### A light greeny/blue, white and black were chosen for my website. The colour rgb(28, 236, 170) popped right off the page and gave my website a theme that I could continue with to carry on that playful sense that my website offers.

# Features


# Testing
## HTML
#### Used https://validator.w3.org/nu/ repeatedly throughout the project.

## CSS 
#### Used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ repeatedly throughout the project.


# Bugs

#### There was a very specific bug that I couldn't get my head around and that was making the form responsive. I soon learned that the container element I was using also corresponded with more of the wesbite that I had first thought. After some research and trial and error, I then switched the way I implemented the background image into the 'Book A Table' section. 

#### The form itself also wouldn't resize properly when moving into an small/extra small screen size which was because I hadn't targeted each column within the form for it to be responsive.

#### Below are some of the code resources that I used to help me and turned into my own.
* Whiskey Project by CodeInstitute - I used the hero image layout and navbar code from the code stored in GitHub on the Whiskey Project to help me get started with the my project although I have changed many elements in that section to give it my own feel. Some of the CSS styling including the styling to the navbar, hero image and buttons still remain whilst I have tweaked them to fit what I wanted to do.

* Bootstrap4 - I used the form table provided in Bootstrap to help me get started with my form table although I styled the form myself.
