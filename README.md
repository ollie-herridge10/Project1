# The IPA Way

### The IPA Way is a crafted Indian Pale Ale business created to contiue the IPA movement across the globe. This website has been created to detail the look, the menu and the location of the new bar that has opened in London.
### The home page offers an overall feel and vibe to the company and what should be expected when you visit the the bar. The menu page gives the website visitor a clear idea of the drinks that will be on offer and some food selections as well. The book page has information around the opening times, ytable booking form and Google Maps location finder.

# Site Owner Goals

* A site made with the IPA industry in mind that pops with unique colours and ease of use.
* Friendly navigation to easily find out what you can drink, eat and do at the bar and find out where it's located.
* An easy booking system highlighted with a vibrant button to be able to book a table within the opening hours shown.

# Customer Experience

* I wanted the customer to feel like they are welcomed to the world of IPAs but can instantly tell that this is a bar and not a place to buy products.
* The easy navigation and scroll through each part of the website is highlighted with bold headings explaing what each part of the website means.
* First time visiters to the websites get a clear indication of who we are, what happens at our bar, where is it and when it's open.
* Reoccuring visitors who come to book a table get that ease of use as the button take them straight to the form.

# Design

## Images
### The images I have incorporated into my website give a real feel of what to expect when you arrive at the bar. The two big hero images show real detail into what the bar looks like and gives off the vibe of the place as well. The smaller images I have portray the finer details about my bar including the fun and games you can have there.

## Fonts
### I chose the Righteous font for my website as I believe it carries the weight of the IPA industry with it. The indsutry is fun and playful so I thought Righteous had the right tone.

## Colours
### A light greeny/blue, white and black were chosen for my website. The colour rgb(28, 236, 170) popped right off the page and gave my website a theme that I could continue with to carry on that playful sense that my website offers.
